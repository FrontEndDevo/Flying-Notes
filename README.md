# Flying Notes Reactjs app

Demo Link: https://frontenddevo.github.io/Flying-Notes/

Now with Flying Notes app, You can easily book(record) your notes in an online book, and of course, you can return in anytime to read, write, and edit your own notes.
Through the Flying Notes app, you can write your notes easily and not only that, you can edit, delete and control them as you want.
Of course, you can create your own account to keep all your notes safe in your account, try the application now through the link above.

Technologies Used:
Reactjs with Redux toolkit and Routing v5 & SASS for styling, I also used Firebase as a Back-End for database & authentication.

Status ðŸ“¶: in-progress.
I got stuck with a Firebase problem, that I don't know how to link or connect the existing account with its notes, I tried searching a lot but I still couldn't solve the problem.
Therefore, my friend, you will find that all the notes you write will be saved in FireBase and will appear to you in any account you create.
I'm sorry about that, but I'm working on this problem.

Here is the planning and analysis phase, which is before the implementation phase, and of course we are missing the maintenance phase, I am working on it in parallel with the rest of my projects on GitHub here.
